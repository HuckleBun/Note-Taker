## Description
These is an app that allows the user to create, edit, and delete notes, and uses an `Express.js` back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

- Entering a new note title and the noteâ€™s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- Clicking on the **SAVE** icon will save that note to the left of the screen.
- Clicking on an existing note will open up that note's contents on the right (you can edit the note from here).
- Clicking on the **PLUS** icon at the top right of your home page, an empty note will appear to the right for you to edit and create.
